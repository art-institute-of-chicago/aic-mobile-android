# Art Institute of Chicago Official Mobile App

> A digital guide to the Art Institute of Chicago. Built with Kotlin 1.x
> for Android.

*Please see
[this page](https://github.com/art-institute-of-chicago/aic-mobile-ios)
for the iOS counterpart.*

The Art Institute of Chicago app is your personal, pocket-sized guide to
our collection. The mobile experience offers high-quality audio
storytelling, letting the art speak to you. The Art Institute offers
nearly a million square feet to explore—the Official Mobile App will be
your guide.

Note that the codebase is young, and under heavy development. It might
change significantly before the first official release. Nevertheless, we
welcome suggestions and contributions from outside parties.
