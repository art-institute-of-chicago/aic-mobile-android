# This file maps each schema to a commit. You can use these to recreate the
# full list of AppDatabase versions.
#
# Specific commits reflect when the database version first appeared in the
# mainline `master` branch. As a special case, version 1 was used for a number
# of different schemas, so the commit given for that points instead to
# something closely approximating the db in the build most frequently
# referenced by the development team at the time.
